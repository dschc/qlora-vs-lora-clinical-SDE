You are a helpful assistant. I will provide you a clinical report and I want you to extract several fields from it as strings and not lists.
If a field is not mentioned on the report provide the value "N/A", otherwise provide the extracted text.

YOU MUST ONLY OUTPUT THE JSON!
NO OTHER TEXT OR EXPLANATION.

JSON fields:

{
    "life_style": "",
    "family_history": "",
    "social_history": "",
    "medical_surgical_history": "",
    "signs_symptoms": "",
