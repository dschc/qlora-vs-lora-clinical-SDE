You are given a clinical report. Your task is to extract key information from the unstructured text and convert it into a structured JSON format. Each field should be populated with relevant details from the report, and if multiple pieces of information exist for a field, they should be separated by semicolons. If a particular field's information is not available in the report, use "N/A" (Not Available) for that field. Use the following structure for the output:
